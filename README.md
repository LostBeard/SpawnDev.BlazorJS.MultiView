Tools for rendering 2D, 2D+Z, Side by Side, Over Under, and other 2D/3D images, videos, or streams in output formats like Green Magenta, Red Cyan, Side by Side, Over Under, glasses-free lenticular, etc. in Blazor WebAssembly applications. 

Thanks to machine learning, depth estimation has improved in leaps and bounds in the past couple years. 
With the right tools, we can now easily convert 2D images and videos to 3D. 
This library's primary goal is to aid the conversion of 2D+Z content created by monocular depth estimation models, like Depth Anything V2, into various 3D formats. Support for other 3D input formats is also planned.

Currently supports 2D+Z to Anaglyph
